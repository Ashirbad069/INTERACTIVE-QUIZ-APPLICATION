## Project Description – Simple Quiz Web Application
This project is a Simple Quiz Web Application, designed to offer users a clean, interactive, and beginner-friendly experience for testing general knowledge. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s the perfect blend of simplicity and functionality, demonstrating how powerful results can be achieved even with the basics of web development.

At its core, the app displays a series of multiple-choice questions one by one. Each question is accompanied by four answer options, and users can simply click on the answer they think is correct. The app then instantly shows whether their choice was right or wrong by highlighting the correct and incorrect answers using dynamic color changes—green for correct and red for wrong. This immediate feedback not only makes the interaction engaging but also helps reinforce learning.

Visually, the user interface is neat and minimalistic. The layout is wrapped in a central container (.app) with a soft-colored background and rounded corners for a modern, user-friendly feel. The use of a calm color palette and smooth transitions enhances the overall look and ensures that the user’s attention remains on the content. Typography is kept clean and legible using the ‘Poppins’ font, making it both stylish and readable.

Functionally, the logic is handled entirely with JavaScript. The application starts by displaying the first question from a predefined list. After the user selects an answer, they are prompted to click the Next button to move forward. The app keeps track of the user’s score behind the scenes and, once all questions are answered, displays a final score summary like “You scored 3 out of 5!”—offering a simple way for users to evaluate their performance.

The project includes five questions, covering topics from world geography to wildlife. Each question object in JavaScript contains a question string and a set of answers, one of which is marked correct. The design makes it easy to scale up—developers can add more questions or adjust content without much effort.

What’s particularly great about this project is its learning value. It’s ideal for beginners who want to understand how the DOM (Document Object Model) works, how to manipulate elements dynamically with JavaScript, and how to apply CSS for responsive and interactive design. It also introduces the idea of state management in a very simple way—tracking which question the user is on and how many answers they got right.

In summary, this quiz app is more than just a small project—it’s a compact learning module wrapped in a practical, real-world interface. Whether used for personal growth, as part of a portfolio, or shared with friends to test their knowledge, it offers an enjoyable and educational experience. Its clean design, responsive feedback, and straightforward functionality make it a strong foundation for more complex projects like competitive quizzes, e-learning platforms, or educational games.
